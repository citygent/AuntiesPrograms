# Aunties Programs

Response to a code-exercise for a well-known broadcasting corporation (other broadcasting corporations are available).

## Brief

```
Your team has been asked to work with a new HTTP API that provides an online media player with lists of programmes sorted alphabetically. Your task is to use the API to generate an A-Z listing for the website.

Each of the listing pages should include:

1. a list of programme titles and images
2. the ability to paginate if the letter has more than 20 results
3. navigation to other letters

```

I am going to write my solution using Angular.
